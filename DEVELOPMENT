                   TO DO LIST
================================================================================

KEY:
(NN) items that have not been implemented
(II) items that are in progress
(CC) items that are complete

ITEMS:

(CC) Move to CMake in order to eliminate the need for out-of-date 
     dependencies fmakedepf90 and fpx3. This requires changing the 
     precompiler flags to be compatible for cpp (C preprocessor) and 
     writing a new CMakeLists.txt file and build process.
     Assigned to CS with testing by JB and TM
     CS - should work on njord, panoramix, and marcc. Ready for testing.
     JB - successfully tested on njord.

(CC) Remove deprecated preprocessor flags DEBUG, VERBOSE, DBLPREC
     Assigned to everyone
     TM - removed DEBUG
     CS - removed DBLPREC and DEVEL(never used anyway)

(CC) Make binary default output with CGNS enabled through compiler flag
     CS - completed

(CC) Remove commented out references to Tecryte
     Assigned to no one
     This has been removed from io.f90

(CC) Remove FFTW2 support
     Assigned to JB

(II) Fix some IO problems caused by removing Tecryte support
     Assigned to TM
     Added points writing capabilities.
     Velocity as a function of time is done by having a single file
     per point called point{number}.dat
     This still needs to be completed for the binary output

(NN) Interpolation from restart files to allow changes in domain size,
     grid size, and domain decomposition for parallelization. 
     Assigned to JB

(CC) Include matlab functions for reading binary output files. 
     Assigned to JB
     After changes to output files for consistency.

(II) Related to task above (matlab functions for reading binary output files),
      add a 'post_processing' folder which includes basic utilities for reading
      data into MATLAB, paraview, vapor, etc.
      Assigned to no one.
      JB - the folder now exists and so far includes the MATLAB scripts.

(II) Cleanup unused lesgo.conf input. This is mostly restart file flags.
     Assigned to no one
     TM -  Removed the initialization flags.
     CS -  Removed Ct_noprime, since you can calculate that from Ct_prime
     There is still more stuff to be cleaned up

(NN) Include developer style guide. This may be contentious and will need to
     be discussed and included incrementally.
     Assigned to no one.

(NN) Include detailed installation notes.
     Assigned to no one.
     Add notes for using gfortran on marcc. Assigned to TM.

(NN) Add folder which includes basic submit scripts for different systems like
      MARCC, panoramix, etc.
      Assigned to no one.
      
(NN) Investigate the near-wall boundary issue in convec.f90 (using first vs 
      second grid point). Should be using first grid point but this has caused
      simulation to blow up.
      Assigned to no one.
      
(CC) Fix compilation issues with level set. Tecryte will have to be disabled and
     replaced by native fortran output. Assigned to CS.
     
(CC) Cleanup README:
      CS - cleaned up removed features
      CS - fixed description of point IO
       
(CC) Cleanup little/big endian read and write. These are inconsistently used in 
     the code.

================================================================================
                   DEVELOPER NOTES
================================================================================
1.  Output file type support:

    Developers MUST support both output types (binary and CGNS). This means that 
    any changes or additions you make to one output type MUST be reflected in the
    other output type.
   
2.  File ID reservations:

    All data files that use a fixed file identifier should be opened using
    "open_file_fid" function. This function provides a mechanism for
    handling the file identifiers of files that will remain open during the
    simulation. It simply provides the file identifier on a first come first
    serve bases starting with 1000. So if any file identifiers are to be used
    that are not provided by the open_file_fid function they should be <1000, 
    but this is discouraged and should only be done if necessary.
   
3.  trees_pre_ls:

    This is a legacy program that may have obsolete or non-working features.
    It was included to preserve the complete functionality of the level set 
    feature and allow new users to test the capabilities (such as arrays of cubes)
    New developers using this program may want to take a closer look and clean up 
    this feature.

================================================================================
                   BROKEN FEATURES
================================================================================
1. Subgrid models 2, 3, and 4 appear to be broken at the moment
2. The spectra calculations are broken (jb)
3. The sgs histograms are disabled (This uses tecplot anyway) (cs)

================================================================================
                   REMOVED FEATURES
================================================================================

1. 2011-09-13: All of the original "buildings" immersed boundary modeling has
   been deemed deprecated and thus removed. To obtain the latest code before the
   remove refer to CVS tag: pre_immersedbc_buildings_remove

2. 2011-09-15: All of the original scalar calculations have been removed. The
   scalar calculations were removed since they 1) are not currently being used
   and 2) should, if reimplemented, be done in a consistent way with the current
   coding constructs of lesgo. To obtain the latest code before the remove refer
   to CVS tag: pre_scalar_calculations_remove 

3. 2016-05-12: All of the RNS and CYL_SKEW_LS modules have been removed. These
   features relied on external libraries and could not be effectively maintained.
   To obtain the source code for these features look at the repository versions
   prior to the posted date.
